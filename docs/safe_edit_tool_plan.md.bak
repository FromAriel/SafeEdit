# Safe Edit Tool Implementation Plan

## Vision
Deliver a Windows-friendly Rust CLI that performs complex text/code edits while guaranteeing review-before-write semantics, deterministic matching, and reversible, atomic changes. The tool must feel as safe and intuitive as manually editing with `apply_patch`, but more powerful for large or multi-file refactors.

## Guiding Principles
- **Preview-first:** Every edit runs in dry mode and shows a full diff before any files are touched.
- **Deterministic targeting:** Searches are exact by default, with explicit regex/wildcard modes plus match-count guards.
- **Encoding aware:** Files are read and written using detected or user-specified encodings; previews normalize to UTF-8.
- **Atomic and reversible:** Writes happen via temp files + rename, optional `.bak` copies, and auto-generated undo patches.
- **Traceable history:** Every applied change records timestamps, commands, and line spans inside a rolling audit log so reviewers can cite edits precisely later.
- **Actionable failures:** When a pattern isn't found, provide the closest matches and context, never silent no-ops.
- **Extensible:** Support simple replacements now, but leave hooks for scripted transforms and batch recipes later.

## High-Level Architecture
1. **Command Parser (clap):** Parses verbs like `replace`, `rename`, `script`, global flags (encoding override, include/exclude globs, dry-run).
2. **File Scanner:** Resolves file sets (respecting glob filters, size limits, binary detection).
3. **Match Engine:** Performs literal/regex/pattern searches, tracks offsets, validates match counts, and captures context for reporting.
4. **Diff Generator:** Uses `similar`/`difflib`-like crate to build unified or side-by-side diffs for preview (colorized via `nu-ansi-term`).
5. **Approval Loop:** Prompts user (and surfaces JSON for automation if needed) to `apply`, `skip`, or `modify` per file or batch.
6. **Write Pipeline:** Creates temp file, applies transformation, validates checksum/size expectations, then atomically swaps and records `.undo.patch`.
7. **Audit Logger:** Appends command metadata, timestamps, and diff hashes to a log for traceability.
8. **Path Resolver & Hinting:** Walks parent directories (up to the drive root) plus one level of nearby siblings to auto-suggest the most likely path when a requested target is missing.

## Command Surface (Initial)
| Command | Purpose | Key Flags |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replace` | Replace a literal or regex match with supplied text. | `--regex`, `--literal`, `--count=N`, `--after-line`, `--encoding`, `--preview-context`, `--diff-only`, `--with-stdin`, `--with-clipboard` |
| `block` | Insert/replace multi-line blocks anchored by sentinels. | `--start-marker`, `--end-marker`, `--mode={insert,replace}` |
| `rename` | Rename identifiers/constants across files (case-preserving). | `--word-boundary`, `--case-aware`, `--files` |
| `review` | Inspect files safely via head/tail, arbitrary line ranges, or interactive stepping. | `--head N`, `--tail N`, `--lines 120-160`, `--search`, `--highlight` |
| `normalize` | Detect and fix encoding/mojibake/zero-width issues in text files without destructive rewrites. | `--encoding auto`, `--strip-zero-width`, `--strip-control`, `--trim-trailing-space`, `--ensure-eol`, `--scan-{encoding,zero-width,control,trailing-space}`, `--report-format {table,json}`, `--convert-encoding <target>`, `--apply` |
| `script` | Run a single-file transform via embedded WASM/Lua/Python sandbox (phase 2). | `--script-file`, `--arg` |
| `batch` | Execute a YAML-defined sequence of commands with one consolidated review. | `--plan plan.yaml` |
| `report` | Summarize change log activity for CI/stand-ups. | `--since <RFC3339>`, `--format {table,json}` |

All commands accept `--dry-run` (default true), `--apply` (skip prompt for automation), `--undo-log <dir>`, `--no-backup`, and `--pager`.

### CLI Semantics
- **Common flags**
  - `--files <globs>` (repeatable): target set; defaults to explicit positional file args.
  - `--include-hidden / --exclude <glob>` to control traversal.
  - `--encoding <auto|utf-8|utf-16-le|...>` override when detection is insufficient.
- `--match-limit <n>` guard for maximum replacements, `--expect <n>` for exact matches.
- `--context <lines>` controls diff preview (default 3).
- `--pager <less|more|none>` chooses preview transport.
- `--color {auto,always,never}` forces ANSI highlighting for diffs (auto defaults to on when stdout is a TTY).
- `--json` emits machine-readable diff metadata for automation.
- **`review`**
  - Modes: `--head <n>` (default 40), `--tail <n>`, `--lines <start:end>`, `--around <line>:<context>`, `--follow` (stream file as it changes).
  - Search: `--search <pattern>` (literal) or `--regex` toggle; matches highlighted with ANSI colors.
  - Interactive stepping: `--step` starts a prompt-driven navigator that echoes absolute line numbers, supports `/pattern` literal or `re:` regex searches, `n/N` match hopping, numeric/`g <line>` jumps, and single-letter bookmarks so dysgraphia-friendly reviews stay fast.
  - Output remains read-only; still passes through encoding normalization for display.
- **`normalize`**
  - Detection toggles: `--scan-encoding`, `--scan-zero-width`, `--scan-control`, `--scan-trailing-space`.
  - Fix toggles (all off unless `--apply`): `--convert-encoding <target>`, `--strip-zero-width`, `--strip-control`, `--trim-trailing-space`, `--ensure-eol`.
  - `--report-format {table,json}` chooses summary style; default prints table with severity levels.
  - Running without `--apply` only reports issues; with `--apply`, tool still shows diff and asks for confirmation.
  - Batch-safe defaults: accepts single files or entire folders but remains non-destructive until `--apply` is confirmed, making it the default "health check" pass for `.txt`, `.md`, and other text assets.

## File Lookup Ergonomics
- Primary lookup honors explicit paths/globs. When a file cannot be opened, the resolver walks parent directories from the working folder up to the drive root (for example, `J:\codextool\safeedit` → `J:\codextool` → `J:\`), checking each level for close matches.
- At every level the resolver also inspects sibling directories one hop away (to catch cases like `docs\` vs. `safeedit\docs\`) so we surface likely matches without spidering the entire drive.
- The user-facing error reads `File <name> not found. Did you mean <Drive:\path\file>?` and can return multiple ranked candidates when ambiguity remains.
- Hints feed back into the CLI so a rerun can be auto-corrected (e.g., `safeedit replace --target docs\safe_edit_tool_plan.md` even when invoked from `safeedit\`).

## Change Tracking & Logging
- All commands share `.safeedit/change_log.jsonl` as a lightweight, append-only queue capped at ~500 entries (configurable). Older entries roll off automatically to keep the file tiny.
- Each entry captures timestamp, verb, arguments, file path, applied/skipped status, a hash of the diff, and the start/end line numbers that changed so reviewers can tie logs back to source quickly.
- `safeedit log --tail N` (and future `--search`, `--since`) exposes the queue without cracking open JSON.
- `safeedit report --since <ts> --format {table,json}` summarizes those entries for CI, status emails, or reviewers.

## Workflow
1. User issues command (e.g., `safeedit replace --files src/**/*.rs --literal "foo" --with "bar"`).
2. Tool expands file list, skipping suspected binaries unless `--force-binary`.
3. For each file, the match engine locates targets; if none, it reports near matches (top-N Levenshtein hits with +/-5 lines context).
4. Diff generator builds unified diff per file plus summary stats (# files, hunks, bytes).
5. Preview printed to console/pager, user chooses:
   - `a` apply all shown changes,
   - `y/n` per file,
   - `e` edit command (returns to prompt without touching files).
6. On apply, tool writes via temp file + `fsync`, optional `.bak` copy, records undo patch, updates audit log.
7. Final status includes reminder to run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`, `cargo test` (or repo-specific commands).

The `review` command shares the preview loop but never writes; it simply paginates head/tail/line-range views (with optional regex highlighting) so large files can be inspected safely before crafting edits.

`normalize` runs in two phases: (1) analysis that reports suspected encoding anomalies, mojibake spans, zero-width or control characters, and trailing space issues; (2) optional apply step that rewrites via temp files only after a diff preview confirms the cleanup. It can target single files or batches and supports `--report-only` for non-destructive audits.

## Safety + Feedback Mechanisms
- **Miss diagnostics:** When zero matches, show suggestions like  
  `No exact match for "FooBar"; closest occurrences:` with line numbers/diff.
- **Match guards:** `--expect <n>` fails if match count differs; `--max <n>` prevents runaway replacements.
- **Encoding handling:** Auto-detect via `chardetng` or BOM; manual override; diff output always UTF-8 to avoid mojibake.
- **UNDO artifacts:** Save `*.undo.patch` (git-style) plus manifest referencing original files & checksums.
- **Backups:** Optional `.bak` or timestamped copies; default on for non-git repos, configurable via `~/.safeedit.toml`.
- **Logging:** Append JSONL entries capturing command, arguments, files touched, diff hash, success/failure.
- **Review mode guarantees:** `review` never writes, always respects encoding detection, and supports piping output to other tools, ensuring inspection actions are side-effect free.
- **Normalization guardrails:** `normalize` defaults to report mode, requires explicit confirmation before altering content, and records both detected issues and applied fixes in the audit log.

## Windows-Oriented Features
- Native path handling via `std::path::PathBuf`.
- Color output respecting `NO_COLOR` and Windows Terminal ANSI support.
- Integration with `less`/`more` fallback; can spawn `code --diff` if requested.
- Safe delete hook to call `Remove-ItemSafely` after successful verification if backups should be cleaned automatically.

## Dependencies (planned)
- `clap` for CLI parsing.
- `globset` + `ignore` for file selection.
- `encoding_rs` / `chardetng` for encoding detection.
- `similar` or `dissimilar` for diff generation.
- `serde` + `serde_json` for logging and batch plans.
- `anyhow` / `miette` for rich error reporting.

## Prototype Status
- Basic CLI scaffold in `safeedit/` now parses all verbs and prints structured summaries.
- File discovery layer honors `--target`, `--glob`, hidden files, excludes, and does lightweight binary detection before edits.
- Encoding strategy module validates overrides up front and auto-detects via BOM + UTF-8 sniff + `chardetng`, exposing decode helpers to downstream commands.
- `review` command prototype loads resolved files, decodes them safely, and prints head/tail/range/around slices with optional literal/regex highlights (defaulting to the first 40 lines if no slice specified). Binary-suspect files are skipped with a warning, and follow mode currently falls back to static preview.
- Transform pipeline now powers `replace`: for each resolved file we decode once, apply literal/regex replacements with optional capture expansion, enforce `--count/--expect`, and render a Myers diff preview via the `similar` crate. All operations remain dry-run with per-file summaries until we add apply/confirm UX.
- `replace` now supports interactive approvals: run with `--apply` to approve each diff (`y/n/a/q`), still defaulting to dry-run previews otherwise. Writes reuse the source encoding and warn about lossy conversions.
- `--yes` auto-approve flag applies all diffs without prompting (useful for CI), still recording each action in the change log.
- Diff previews are now colorized (green inserts, red deletes) and respect `--color {auto,always,never}` so big patches are easier to scan inline.
- Undo archives: passing `--undo-log <dir>` now writes a unified `.patch` per applied file (new ➜ old) so we can roll back later without relying on Git.
- Missing-path ergonomics: when a requested file isn't found, the tool now walks every ancestor plus the drive root, tries each suffix of the requested path (not just the file name), and inspects immediate child directories so we can suggest paths like `..\docs\guides\plan.md` even when the command ran out of `safeedit\src\`.
- Zero-match diagnostics: literal/regex replacements that find no hits now surface the top three fuzzy matches, including line/column numbers, snippets, and inline diff markers so typos are easy to spot and correct.
- Rolling change log: every replace run appends JSONL entries to `.safeedit/change_log.jsonl` capturing timestamp, command, path, action, line summary, and the specific line spans impacted (distinguishing modified vs. added). The log retains the latest ~500 entries for lightweight code-review breadcrumbs.
- `review --step` engages an interactive line navigator (Enter/`j`=next line, `b`/`p`/`k`=previous, `g`/`G` jump to head/tail, `/pattern` sets a literal/`re:` regex search, `n`/`N` hop between matches, `m` drops a bookmark, `'` jumps back, numeric or `g <line>` jumps work as shortcuts, `q` exits) so dysgraphia-friendly walkthroughs never require leaving the terminal or losing context.
- Replace input ergonomics: `--diff-only` forces preview-only runs (even with `--apply`), while `--with-stdin` and `--with-clipboard` let us feed large replacements without wrestling with shell quoting.
- Auto-approve summaries: replace/normalize now finish with a concise applied/skipped/dry-run/no-op report so unattended runs (e.g., `--yes`) still show what happened.
- `safeedit report --since <ts>` condenses change-log entries into per-command/action summaries (table or JSON) so CI jobs or stand-ups can cite what happened without tailing raw logs.
- Batch runner: `safeedit batch --plan plan.yml` loads YAML/JSON recipes (with per-step `common` overrides) and replays `replace`/`normalize` steps through the usual preview + approval loop, so multi-command refactors stay reviewable without ad-hoc scripts.
- `safeedit report --since <ts>` condenses change-log entries into per-command/action summaries (table or JSON) so CI jobs or stand-ups can cite what happened without tailing raw logs.
- `safeedit log --tail N` prints the most recent change-log entries (timestamp, command, action, line summary, path) so reviewers can quickly audit what changed without opening the JSONL file.
- Normalize command now supports detection toggles (`--scan-*`), `--report-format json` for machine-readable health checks, and `--convert-encoding <label>` so apply runs can transcode and clean in one pass; table output remains the default for interactive use.
- Unit tests cover the new helpers (file dedupe/normalization, encoding detection, review parsing/highlighting).

### Upcoming polish
- Diff UX polish: add side-by-side output, smarter pager integration, and optional HTML/exported reports for sharing diffs.
- Review ergonomics: extend `--step` with multi-bookmarks, search result listings, and copy-to-clipboard/export commands so longer reviews remain fast even when scanning thousands of lines.

## Build & Verification Commands
Run these from `safeedit/`:
1. `cargo fmt`
2. `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`
3. `cargo test`
Latest verification (2025-11-07, 16:00 UTC): all three commands passed successfully after enabling the replace pipeline.
Enable `RUST_LOG=safeedit=debug` when we add logging, and consider `cargo nextest`/`cargo tarpaulin` later for faster test cycles and coverage.

## Future Enhancements
- Batch plan authoring UI (YAML/JSON templates).
- Language server hints for symbol renames.
- Pluggable diff viewers (e.g., HTML export).
- VS Code/Editor integration that shells out to `safeedit`.

This plan keeps the editing experience transparent, reviewable, and recoverable while giving us headroom to automate ever more complex transformations safely.
